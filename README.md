# Text-Outliner-Bot

Text Summarizer can be defined as tool which wraps up the text to short length texts in precise and concise way. Through this tool, we aim to reduce articles, papers, or documents down to the key points instantly. Our Summarization Bot uses natural language processing to locate important feratures while maintaining the original context and differentae important sentences from redundant sentences.
Trained using scraped data from Wikipedia, our text summarizer can summarize a book, an article, or a research paper. It uses deep learning to create novel sentences and generates a summary in which the main idea remains intact.


## Results

We train the model with an extensive training dataset from Wikipedia. The main two results are shown in the images below. The most helpful information was found in early and last sentences to highlight the overall trends. The metrics used to evaluate the result are Rouge-L scores. The rouge-L is used to measure the sequence length and check the ratio with the reference sequence in the corpus. The model showed an average Rouge-L score of 30% to 50%. The result can be future be improved with more hyperparameter tunning and extensive training of more datasets.
